# DiverseRL

---
**DiverseRL** is a RL(Reinforcement Learning) repository that aims to

1. implement RL algorithms of various topics and
2. easily benchmark the implemented algorithms
3. in wide variety of environments.

In the field of Reinforcement Learning, there exists many sub-fields/topics such as model-based RL, offline RL, meta RL.

I am planning to code not only those basic RL algorithms(e.g. DQN, TD3, SAC, etc.) but also those sub-field RL algorithms in this repository, too.


## Algorithms
