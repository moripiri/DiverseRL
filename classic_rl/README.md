# Classic RL algorithms

---
## Overview
In this repo, the term '**Classic RL**' is used for these basic RL algorithms. 

* Model-free Monte Carlo
* SARSA
* Q-learning
* REINFORCE(Monte-Carlo Policy Gradient)
* Actor-Critic
* Dyna-Q

For baseline, these two dynamic programming (DP) algorithms are available.
* Policy iteration
* Value iteration

## Environments
**Classic RL** algorithms are only applicable to **gymnasium**'s *toy text* environments.
